# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Setup for GitHub Pages

Your Cetal Deve Solutions website is now configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages!

### ✅ What's Already Configured:

1. **Next.js Configuration** (`next.config.js`)
   - Static export enabled
   - GitHub Pages path configuration
   - Image optimization disabled for static hosting

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`)
   - Automatic build and deployment on push to main branch
   - Uses official GitHub Pages actions
   - Caches dependencies for faster builds

3. **Build Scripts** (`package.json`)
   - `npm run build` - Standard Next.js build with static export
   - `npm run build-static` - Explicit static export command

### 🎯 Setup Steps:

#### 1. Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/CetalDeve/CetalDeveSolutions
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Click **Save**

#### 2. Push Changes (Triggers First Deployment)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin main
```

#### 3. Monitor Deployment
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Watch the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Once complete, your site will be live!

### 🌐 Your Website URL:
After deployment, your site will be available at:
```
https://cetaldeve.github.io/CetalDeveSolutions/
```

### 🔄 Automatic Updates:
- Every push to the `main` branch automatically triggers a new deployment
- Changes are live within 2-3 minutes
- No manual intervention required

### 🛠️ Local Testing Before Deployment:
```bash
# Test the build locally
npm run build

# Serve the static files locally
npx serve out
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### 📁 File Structure After Build:
```
out/               # Static export directory (auto-generated)
├── index.html     # Homepage
├── 404.html       # Error page
├── _next/         # Next.js assets
├── Blog/          # Blog section
├── Contact/       # Contact page
├── Careers/       # Careers page
└── ...            # Other pages and assets
```

### 🔧 Troubleshooting:

#### Build Failures:
- Check the Actions tab for error logs
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Test build locally first: `npm run build`

#### 404 Errors:
- GitHub Pages may take a few minutes to propagate
- Ensure the repository is public
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in settings

#### Asset Loading Issues:
- The configuration includes proper base paths for GitHub Pages
- Images and CSS should load correctly with the subdirectory setup

### 🚀 Performance Features:
- ✅ Static file generation for fast loading
- ✅ Optimized assets and minification
- ✅ CDN delivery via GitHub Pages
- ✅ HTTPS enabled by default
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
